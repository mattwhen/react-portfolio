				Hi, welcome to my webpage. My name is Matt, and I am a full-stack
				developer. I like to code, eat, and play video games.

				I currently work in IT any my day-to-day responsibilites include
				translating technical concepts into something that a non-technical user
				can understand, and solving many of their technical complications.

				With these current skillsets, I believe it will can assist me in
				becoming a better developer. I wanted to become a developer due to my
				passion in solving problems, and creating products for users.
